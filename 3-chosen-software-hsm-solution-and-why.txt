RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE HSM FOR TI SOC DEVELOPMENT
################################################################################

This document summarizes the requirements for a software HSM solution
during the development and testing phases for a Texas Instruments SoC
reference board implementation, and recommends the most suitable option
based on those needs.

================================================================================
USER REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

The key requirements for the software HSM solution are:

1. Target Platform: Texas Instruments SoC reference board implementation.
2. Development Stage: Primarily for development and testing.
3. Cost-Effectiveness: No additional financial outlay for implementing a
secure solution during development and testing stages.
4. Hardware HSM Migration: Easy transfer to a production-grade hardware
HSM solution with minimum or no effort.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: PKCS#11-BASED SOFTWARE HSM (E.G., SOFTHSM)
================================================================================

Based on the analysis of various software HSM types from
2-software-hsm-types.txt, a PKCS#11-Based Software HSM, such as SoftHSM,
is the ideal choice for these requirements.

Justification:
-------------

1.  Cost-Effectiveness (No Additional Money):
   - Free and Open-Source: Solutions like SoftHSM are entirely free
     and open-source, eliminating any upfront purchase costs or
     ongoing licensing fees during development and testing.

2.  Easy Transfer to Hardware HSM:
   - Standardized API: PKCS#11 is a widely adopted,
     platform-independent API standard for cryptographic tokens. Most
     commercial hardware HSMs are PKCS#11 compliant.
   - Seamless Migration: By developing and testing against the PKCS#11
     interface using SoftHSM, the application code can interact with a
     production hardware HSM (also PKCS#11 compliant) with minimal or
     no code changes. The transition primarily involves configuring the
     application to load the hardware HSM's PKCS#11 library instead of
     SoftHSM's.

3.  Suitability for Development and Testing:
   - Prototyping and Testing: PKCS#11 software HSMs are specifically
     recommended for development and testing workflows as they provide
     a functional environment for building and validating
     cryptographic operations before deployment to a more secure and
     costly hardware solution.

While the Texas Instruments SoC itself may possess integrated hardware
security features (which would be leveraged by "Embedded Software HSM
Libraries" or potentially TPM-backed solutions if a TPM is present),
these do not offer the same direct and standardized migration path to an
external, dedicated hardware HSM as a PKCS#11 software implementation
provides.

Therefore, for projects aiming for a cost-free development and testing
phase with a clear path to hardware HSM integration, SoftHSM is the most
appropriate software HSM solution.
